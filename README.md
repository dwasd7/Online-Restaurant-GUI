Welcome!  

To start, first access the customer form by logging in with a preexisting account (username: customerAccount@gmail.com - password: customer) or create your own. 

Once logged in, peruse the menu and add whichever items to your cart. 

Click the cart button at the top right to be directed to the items in your cart, which will also tell you the total cost. 

When you are ready to check out, add your information.

The address must be in the form of Address, City, State.

The card number must also be valid.

The following can be used for card info as a test: 
  address: 919 Blue Mountain, Nashville, TN - zip: 37013 - card number: 5555555555554444 - cvv: 123 - date: 04/28 - name: Customer Account
  
The order history can be checked, with the most recent order showing up at the bottom.

The account settings page can also be visited, and updates user information.

From here, sign out and login to the preexisting test manager account. (username: managerAccount@gmail.com - password: manager)

The current screen shows incoming orders, and if you click refresh, the order you just placed will show up at the bottom.

You can move each order along individually from pending to accepted to ready, or you can cancel it.

The view menu button shows the current menu items that are being offered, and these can be edited with the edit menu button. 

To use this, enter the menu id number, update any other information, and check the box if you want the menu item to show. 

The restaurant profile page shows current restaurant information, and allows you to change any information if needed. 

The account settings button allows you to view and edit manager account information, however the email cannot be changed.
